# 🎮 Rectangles

Rectangles is a simple game project originally developed in Java, then converted to C++ using the SFML graphics library.

# 📌 Objectives

This project is divided into two main levels:
🔹 Level 1: Java Development

    Build the game entirely in Java to learn the language and practice basic programming concepts, object-oriented design, and game loops.

🔹 Level 2: C++ Conversion

    Recreate the same game in C++ for personal growth and deeper understanding of:

    Language conversion techniques (Java → C++)

    Object-oriented programming in C++

    Game development using SFML

    Manual memory management and performance optimization

# ⚙️ creator.sh

A shell script to simplify compiling and running the C++ version using the SFML library, which requires proper linking.

It automates:

    Compilation of all .cpp and .hpp files

    Linking SFML libraries

    Running the compiled game

Make sure you have SFML installed and properly configured in your environment before using this script.

# 🛠️ Requirements
For Java version:

    Java JDK 8 or higher

For C++ version:

    A C++17 compatible compiler (e.g., g++)

    SFML Library

# 🚀 How to Run
Java:

cd Java
javac *.java
java Game

C++:

cd CPP
./creator.sh

# ✨ Future Improvements

    Add sound effects and background music

    Implement a score system and levels

    Create a pause/resume feature

    Improve UI and animations
